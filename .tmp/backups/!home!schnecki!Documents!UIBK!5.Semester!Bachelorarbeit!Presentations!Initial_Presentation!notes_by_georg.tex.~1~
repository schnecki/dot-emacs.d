      \textbf{We need:}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item to assign resource information to types (and constructors)
      \item a well-typed (annotated typed) TRS $\mathcal{R}$
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{to bound the runtime of $\mathcal{R}$}

      \center{
        This was developed by Georg Moser in \cite{MoserNotes}.
      }
      % the types assigned to the constructors and defined symbols
      % of  $\mathcal{F}$ provide us with sufficient
      % information to bound the runtime of $\mathcal{R}$. `` \cite{MoserNotes}
