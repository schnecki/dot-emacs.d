  %     \item \textbf{Resource Analysis}
  %       \newline Analysis of Resource Consumption, like memory (heap,
  %       stack), time...
  %       \newline e.g. How much does it cost to put an integer on the
  %       heap.
  %       \newline\newline
  %       However, when analysing a program, this leads to a problem:
  %       \newline Summing up all of the costs for each single operation
  %       is inaccurate. \newline

  %       \begin{framed}
  %         Example Memory Analysis of Program from \cite{tarjan85}:\newline
  %         Some function f only temporarly allocates a lot of memory.
  %         \newline Summing up all costs including temporarly used one
  %         is very pessimistic.

      \newline e.g. How much does it cost to put an integer on the

        \textbf{Problems} shown by \cite{tarjan85}:
        \begin {itemize}
        \item Sum of Worst-Case Costs (e.g Times) may be Unduly
            Pessimistic
          \newline \footnotesize{It ignores correlated effects of the
            operations on the data structure.}
        \item \normalsize {Average-Case Analysis may be Inaccurate}
          \newline \footnotesize {Probabilistic Assumptions needed to
            carry out the analysis may be false.}

      \textbf{Amortised Resource Analysis}  \cite{tarjan85} \newline
      average of costs per operation over a sequence of operations

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Banker's View:} Credit operated computer.
          \newline Program is not
          allowed to use more than the given amount of credits. Unused
          credits carry over to later operations.
        \item \textbf{Physicist's View:} Potential Function $\Phi$.
          \newline Maps any configuration of the data structure into a
          real number.
        \end{itemize}

        \exampleBox{
          Example:\newline
          A sequence of operations need $x$ credits for execution.
          Therefore, it can only be called, if at
          least $x$ credits are available. Afterwards it
          might leave some credits for later operations (which may have
          been used temporally).
