Adaptive lead time quotation in a pull production system with lead time
Department of Industrial Engineering, College of Engineering, Bahçeşehir University, Istanbul, Turkey
In this paper, a single-stage single-class kanban controlled manufacturing system is considered, where
the problem is quoting accurate lead times for orders that are generated by an MRP system. Order release
mechanism as in classical MRP is sensitive to the changes in the lead time according to the concept of lead
time syndrome. The objective is to establish a cost effective lead time quoting procedure. The problem
is modeled as a two-dimensional Markov chain, and it is solved explicitly by using matrix geometric
techniques. Comparative analysis is done between static and dynamic lead time quoting procedures, and
signiﬁcant cost beneﬁts of the dynamic procedure are shown under various scenarios. Guidelines for
setting design parameters such as the number of kanbans and the frequency of updating the lead time

The terms push and pull have been widely used to characterize
the underlying decision making process in a wide variety of manufacturing and distribution systems. In general, pull systems use
local information about the status of production and inventories to
authorize the order releases, while push systems use global information including the ﬁrm and forecasted customer orders, lead
Kanban is the most widely known pull type production control
system. As the ﬁnished goods inventory is depleted and containers are emptied, kanban cards attached to each container are
released to authorize production in order to replenish the consumed ﬁnished goods. Research on kanban type production control
systems is huge. Akturk and Erhun [1], Kumar and Panneerselvam
[16] and Junior and Filho [11] include a comprehensive review
of various approaches and techniques for the analysis of kanban
systems. Some recent examples include Erhun et al. [4], Koukoumialos and Liberopoulos [14], Krieg and Kuhn [15], and Iwase and
Ohno [9] for performance evaluation and optimization of kanban
systems. Majority of the literature aims to establish valid relationships between some design parameters (number of kanbans,
kanban sizes, order cycle, and safety stock level) and the performance measures (total cost, throughput, inventory and WIP levels,
utilization and ﬁll rate) and to ﬁnd (near) optimal values of design

parameters under various production and demand settings. One
important assumption that is commonly made in the literature is
that demand for the product(s) is generated by some external stationary process, and information ﬂow is limited to one direction in
terms of orders from a downstream stage to an upstream stage. In
this paper, we question this assumption by modeling a kanban system within an information-feedback framework. There have been
various examples of information-feedback framework modeled in
a production planning and control setting such as Takahashi and
Nakamura [28], Pandey et al. [22], and Masin and Prabhu [17]. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to present an exact
analysis of adaptive lead times in a Kanban/MRP setting.
In a supply chain context it is possible to have both push
and pull type systems tied together with ﬂows of information
in both directions, for example, capacity and lead time information from upstream to downstream and demand information from
downstream to upstream. Joint consideration of push and pull
systems has been an interesting research topic in the literature
(e.g., [3,5,8,20]) such that the main motivation was to eliminate
the drawbacks of both systems by designing an effective integration. The technique utilized by Flapper et al. [5] and Nagendra and
Das [20] was to have MRP as responsible for the order generation
and Kanban/JIT for the execution of production and material ﬂow
between stages of production. In Nagendra and Das [20], the lead
time parameter is dynamically adjusted based on the production
characteristics and utilization. The new lead time parameter is then
feedback to both MRP and Kanban systems. Such an informationfeedback system is similar to the setting we analyzed in this paper.
However, as suggested by J.W. Forrester in his pioneering work

[6] “. . . a complex information-feedback system designed by happenstance or in accordance with what may be intuitively obvious
will usually be unstable and ineffective.” Thus, within the context
of Kanban/MRP integration, it is worthwhile to analyze the cyclic
effects of adjusting lead times, which is called the lead time syndrome in the literature. Such cyclic effects are ignored in the well
established due date setting literature where the main concern is
to set optimal due dates for exogenously generated orders (e.g.,
In this paper, we consider a situation where a kanban controlled
manufacturing system is responsible for providing accurate supply related information such as lead times to an MRP system that
releases production orders. The lead times are quoted based on
the status information of the production system such as WIP and
backlog levels, and MRP system plans and releases orders according to the quoted lead times. It has been argued in the literature
that once the lead times are updated dynamically, this will cause
the orders to be released in a more lumpy manner, and thus, lead
time syndrome occurs. In response to larger work-in-process (WIP)
levels, longer lead times are quoted, then orders are released earlier
to cover increased expected demand during the longer lead time.
This leads to longer queues in the shop ﬂoor, which in turn, lead to
further increases in the quoted lead time. The reverse case holds for
decreasing lead times. For some conceptual discussions on the lead
time syndrome we refer to Mather and Plossl [18], Plossl [23], and
Kingsmanet al. [13]. A simulation study by Selçuk et al. [27] provides
experimental results for the existence of the lead time syndrome
in a push type system. Further, Selçuk et al. [26], through an exact
analytical model, shows that the lead time syndrome increases the
variability in the manufacturing system, and leads to higher average
WIP levels, and thus, longer ﬂow times are experienced. These studies emphasize the fact that once different lead times are quoted, the
order release mechanism will be affected in a way to increase the
variability in the system. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how
this phenomenon can be incorporated into establishing an effective
lead time quoting procedure. Especially, in such an informationfeedback system, there are two important factors that needs to be
carefully considered. These are (1) the frequency with which the
updating is performed and (2) the response probability such that
the order release mechanism reacts to changing lead times. In this
paper, we explicitly model these factors separately, and we aim to
provide quantitative insights on their roles.
The time between a customer places an order and the customer
receives the order in a kanban controlled system has been considered under different names in the literature. Kim and Tang [12]
uses response time. Yavuz and Satir [29] uses mean total demand
satisfaction lead time. Kumar and Panneerselvam [16] also identiﬁes the response time as an important performance measure for
kanban controlled systems. Kanban systems, by limiting WIP levels, are powerful in controlling manufacturing lead times between
certain limits. However, short manufacturing lead times with
low variability do not necessarily induce short and less variable
response times [31]. This argument is supported by a simulation study of Yücesan and De Groote [30]. Kim and Tang [12]
is the ﬁrst to determine the optimal number and size of kanbans that minimize the average manufacturing lead time, and
at the same time, satisfy a service level constraint on response
time. Although these studies provide valuable insights on the
impacts of various design variables on the response time, they
consider the response time as a statistical measure (not as a
quoted parameter), and assume that the demand process is independent of the response time. In this paper, different from the
existing literature, we present an exact model of adaptive kanban response time (quoted lead time) such that the demand
(orders released by MRP system) is sensitive to the quoted lead
In summary, we aim to answer the following research questions:
1 How to quote dynamically adjusted planned lead times in a kanban/MRP integration?
2 What is the effect of lead time syndrome?
3 What are the effects of design parameters such as the number of
kanbans, the update frequency and the response probability?
This paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the
detailed problem description is provided together with an explicit
explanation of the lead time syndrome. Then, in Section 3 the
problem is modeled by a Quasi-Birth-Death process, and an exact
solution of this model is given. Section 4 presents various quantitative results generated by the solution of the model under different
cases. In Section 5 the paper is concluded with some future research
There is a single-stage single-class kanban controlled manufacturing system that dynamically quotes planned lead times to an
MRP system that, accordingly, releases orders. We assume that the
orders follow the dynamics of the lead time syndrome. A detailed
description of the lead time syndrome is provided in the following
Consider an item for which production orders are released in
integer multiples of a lot size x. Let us denote the lead time of the
item as L. Let us also deﬁne (t) as the expected release rate of lot
size x at time t ≥ 0. The expected total demand for the item during
a period of time between now and a future time t > 0 is denoted by
d(0, t), and d(t) is the expected demand rate at time t > 0. Let us also
deﬁne the inventory position at time t ≥ 0 by IP(t). Then,
Consider that after a planned release of an order at time t > 0 the
next order is planned to be released at time t + t. Then,
(t + t) · x = d(t + t, t + t + L) − IP(t + t)
= d(t + t, t + t + L) − (d(t, t + L) − d(t, t + t))
This means that the planned release rate at time t > 0 chases the
demand rate with a time lag equal to the lead time.
Eqs. (1) and (2) demonstrate the fact that an update in the
lead time at time t = 0 creates a signiﬁcant effect in the current
release rate, and the effect on the planned release rates in the
future depends on the stationarity of the demand process. When L
is increased by L then, (0) is increased by (0) = d(L, L + L)/x,
and (t), t > 0, is changed by (t) = d(t + L + L) − d(t + L)/x. Similarly, when L is decreased by L then, (0) is decreased by
(0) = d(L − L, L)/x, and the change in the planned release rate
at time t > 0 is (t) = d(t + L − L) − d(t + L)/x.
Given that the demand is stationary with a ﬁxed mean, d(t) = d,
then the effect of updating the lead time is formulated by

Eq. (3) and (4) indicate that for a stationary demand process, updating the lead time does only affect the current release rate, and future
planned release rates remain unaffected. However, this is based on
the assumption that the lead time is ﬁxed during the rest of the time,
which is a common assumption in MRP systems. Eq. (3) implies
that whenever the lead time is increased, then additional orders
are generated, and whenever the lead time is decreased, then some
There is a ﬁxed number of kanbans in the manufacturing system,
each attached to a container of ﬁnished goods. If there are available
ﬁnished goods, then an order is satisﬁed directly. In case of stock
out, the unsatisﬁed order waits in the backlog queue. Let us denote
br (t) as the number of orders in the backlog queue at time t. The
quoted lead time reﬂects the perceived duration of time that the
next order will be satisﬁed. The perception is reﬂected through an
update parameter r. There is also L0 that refers to the minimum
allowable lead time. The lead time quoted at time t is
The second term in the right-hand-side of Eq. (5) implies that the
lead time is changed by every change of size r in the backlog level.
This directly implies that the value of r gives the frequency with
which the lead time is updated. The bigger r is, the lower the update
We consider two different types of performance measures, internal and external. The internal performance measure relates to the
efﬁciency of the manufacturing system with respect to the total
amount of WIP and ﬁnished goods inventory, which is ﬁxed to
the number of Kanban cards, K. The external performance measure refers to the performance related to the order deliveries. The
delivery performance in our case has three dimensions. These are
backlogs, the length of the lead time, and tardy deliveries.
Let E[B] and E[L] are respectively the average backlog level and
the average lead time. Similarly, E[T] refers to the expected number
of tardy deliveries that are completed (not canceled). Let ch and cb
be respectively the inventory holding cost and the backlog cost of
one container. cL is the penalty cost for each unit of the quoted lead
time, and cT is the cost of late delivery of an order to the customer.
The objective is to minimize the total cost of
TC (K, r) = ch K + cb E[B] + cL E[L] + cT E[T ].

of the process {Xr (t), t ≥ 0} with r = 3 is provided in Fig. 1. We consider a setting (as also suggested by McKay and Wiers [19]) where
the order release planner does not only act as an executor but also
assumes a role as an anticipator, and this is incorporated into our
model through the response probability ˇ.
This process has a Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) structure. Let us
deﬁne this QBD process by {Yr (t), t ≥ 0} with Yr (t) = (L̂r (t), b̂r (t)),
where L̂r (t) = Lr (t) − L0 and b̂r (t) = W (t) − K − r L̂r (t). Level 0 of this
process has states {(0, − K), (0, − K + 1), . . ., (0, r − 2), (0, r − 1)}. For
l = 1, 2, . . ., level l of this QBD process is composed of r states with
state space as {(l, 0), (l, 1), . . ., (l, r − 2), (l, r − 1)}. The transition rate
diagram in Fig. 1 can be transformed into a simpler representation
Deﬁne ım,n as the Kronecker delta; ım,n = 1 if m = n, and ım,n = 0
/ n. In order to conveniently describe the inﬁnitesimal generator of the process {Yr (t), t ≥ 0}, we will employ the following
notation for arbitrary integer k. I(k) is the k dimensional iden(k)
tity matrix. TR is the k dimensional right drift matrix, (TR )m,n =
ım,n−1 , m, n = 0, 1, . . ., k − 1. TL is the k dimensional left drift matrix,

column vector with 1 on the (m + 1)th row, (em )n = ım,n , m, n = 0,
A Markov chain model is developed in order to evaluate the performance of the manufacturing system for any given values of K, r,
We assume that the backlog queue discipline is First-ComeFirst-Serve, and the lot size is equal to the mean demand, x = d,
which is also equal to the container size. Order arrivals from the
customer follows a Poisson process with a ﬁxed rate of , and production cycle time for each container is exponentially distributed
with a ﬁxed mean of 1/. We model this queueing system as a twodimensional Markov process deﬁned by {Xr (t), t ≥ 0}, Xr (t) = (W(t),
Lr (t)), where W(t) is the total amount of WIP in the system at time
t, and Lr (t) is the lead time at time t quoted by Eq. (5).
When br (t) = r · (Lr (t) − L0 ) + r − 1, an arrival triggers an increase
in the lead time, and an additional order is released immediately
with probability ˇ. When br (t) = r · (Lr (t) − L0 ), a departure triggers a
decrease in the lead time, and an order in the production backlog is
canceled immediately with probability ˇ. As long as br (t) remains in
between, the lead time is kept constant. The transition rate diagram

It is analytically not possible to present a closed form expression for the average number of tardy deliveries. The reason is that
some of the orders are canceled, and thus, should not be counted
as tardy. Besides, the delivered orders are tardy when the actual
delivery time exceeds the quoted lead time (which is changing
continuously). Therefore, we provide an approximation for E[T].

In this paper we aim to make a comparison between static and
dynamic cases, to show the conditions under which dynamically
quoting lead times might be preferable over the static lead times,
and to provide insights about the impact of lead time syndrome.
We consider r = 2, 3, and 4, where r = 2 represents the case with
the highest update frequency, and r = 4 is the case with the lowest
update frequency. In addition, ˇ = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.0 are considered.
ˇ = 1.0 represents the case that the planner reacts to every change
in the lead time, and ˇ = 0.0 represents the case that orders are
independent of the change in the lead time and thus, the lead time
syndrome does not exist in this case. We also consider the number
of kanbans as a design variable with K = 1 and 4. In addition, different utilization levels of  = 0.80 and 0.95 are taken into account. For
all cases the value of  is ﬁxed to 20. Thus, for  = 0.80 and 0.95,
we set respectively  = 16 and 19. Cost parameters, which represent different product characteristics and delivery requirements,
are also important to provide insights about the performance of
the dynamic and the static cases. In general, due to the nature of
the problem the main goal is to quote accurate and short lead times.
Thus, the costs associated with the length of the lead time and tardiness are expected to be high, and the backlog cost is expected to
be low. We choose (ch , cb , cL , cT ) = (1, 1, 3, 20) to represent the case
with high tardiness costs and low inventory and lead time costs. (ch ,
cb , cL , cT ) = (10, 1, 15, 20) represents the case with expensive items
with high inventory holding and lead time costs. Table 1 gives the
list of all design factors, their treatment levels and the number of
treatments for each factor. Applying a full-factorial design, there
are in total 80 different treatments. First, both the static lead time
and L0 are set to zero, and we show the effects of the factors given
in Table 1. Further, we also ﬁnd optimal values of static lead time,
L0 , K, and r that give the minimum total cost both for static and
dynamic cases. In the static case, the optimal lead time is found by
marginal analysis. In the dynamic case, for each choice of r the optimal K and L0 are found by enumeration. As r increases the dynamic
case converges to the static case, and search for r that gives minimum cost is stopped. Through these results, we show the relative
percentage improvement in total cost by dynamically updating the
lead time under different cost parameters and utilization levels.
Assuming that there are no order cancelations, the expected number of tardy deliveries is given by
By using the results of the previous section we can ﬁnd exact
expressions for E[B] and E[L] as in the following propositions.
Table 2 provides the numerical results for  = 0.80 and  = 0.95.
L0 = 0 for all dynamic cases, and for the static case, the quoted lead
time is also taken as zero. TC1 refers to the total cost of the case

with (ch , cb , cL , cT ) = (1, 1, 3, 20), and TC2 refers to the total cost of
the case with (ch , cb , cL , cT ) = (10, 1, 15, 20).
The insights gathered from the numerical results in Table 2 are
as follows. As r increases (in other words as the update frequency
decreases) then the average backlog level and the average lead time

Performance measures for  = 0.80 and  = 0.95.
decrease. The backlog level decreases, because the impact of the
lead time syndrome will become less when the update frequency
is less. The average lead time is also shorter, because the lead time
is not increased until a larger increase in the backlog level is seen.
The average number of tardy orders increases, because for the same
backlog size a shorter lead time is quoted when the update frequency decreases.
Decreasing the value of ˇ means that the lead time syndrome is
experienced in a decreasing degree since now, the planner at the
downstream stage less frequently reacts to changes in the lead time.
As a result of less responsive planner the average backlog level and
the average lead time decreases as ˇ decreases. On the other hand,
the average number of tardy deliveries increases.
Increasing the number of kanbans will decrease the average
backlog level, the average lead time, and the average tardiness.
Because, in this case, more orders are satisﬁed directly from stock,
and the actual delivery times drop as well as the quoted lead
times. That is, backlog costs and delivery performance related
costs drop as the number of kanbans increases. But the inventory
cost increases. As the utilization level increases the impact of K
decreases. For higher utilization levels the system operates most of
the time at higher backlog levels, and the impact of changing the
number of kanbans becomes limited as compared to the case with
In order to maintain the quoted lead time at almost the same
level, the update frequency must be decreased when the utilization level increases, and this will be in expense of higher number
of tardy deliveries. Under the current choice of cost parameters we
see that, for a low utilization level, since the congestion in the shop
ﬂoor is not high, the lead time syndrome may result in lower total
cost when there is low backlog and lead time costs. When there is
high lead time cost or when the utilization level is high, the case
without the lead time syndrome, ˇ = 0, is a preferable situation. For
a low utilization level, the highest update frequency, r = 2, is preferable for all response probabilities. For a high utilization level, the
preferable update frequency changes depending on the cost parameters and the response probability. For a high utilization level, the
congestion in the shop ﬂoor can increase rapidly, and this may lead
to longer lead times. Thus, for the case with high lead time costs r = 4

is preferable. For the case with low lead time costs, r = 3 is preferable for ˇ = 1.0 and ˇ = 0.5. Since, the lead time syndrome does not
exist for ˇ = 0, a higher update frequency with r = 2 is preferable in
this case. That is, when the degrading effect of the lead time syndrome is high as in the case with higher utilization level and higher
response probabilities, in order to smooth the effects of the lead
time syndrome, a less frequent updating is preferable.
Both the update frequency and the response probability have
signiﬁcant effects on how the lead time syndrome drives the system performance. Our results indicate that an increased update
frequency is more effective than an increased response probability for decreasing the tardiness. The relationship of E[L] and E[T]
for different r and ˇ values for the case of K = 4 and  = 0.95 is
visualized in Fig. 3. There is a smoother decrease in tardiness as
ˇ increases, however, there are signiﬁcant shifts in tardiness for
different update frequencies. The graph also shows that an efﬁcient frontier between E[L] and E[T] will include those cases with
ˇ = 0, where the lead time syndrome does not occur. This is logical,
because the lead time syndrome increases the variability in order

exposition, in each scenario, the larger total cost is represented by
100 in order to show the percentage differences between dynamic
and static cases. Depending on the utilization level and the cost
parameters, more than 30% saving in total cost is achieved by
dynamically updating the lead time. The saving will be higher for
a higher utilization level. In almost all cases, dynamically updating
the lead time with its optimal design parameters will lead to a lower
average backlog level, a shorter average lead time and a smaller
average number of tardy deliveries. Therefore, updating the lead
time generates signiﬁcant cost savings in all cases. Tables 3 and 4
also reveal that, in the static case, the response to relatively expensive tardiness cost is by increasing the static lead time (from L = 1
to L = 2 for  = 0.80 and from L = 3 to L = 5 for  = 0.95), whereas in
the dynamic case, this is done by increasing the update frequency.
That is, the concept of update frequency can be used as a ﬁne tuning
mechanism for different cost parameters in the dynamic case.
Fig. 4 displays the minimum total costs versus r values, for different values of ˇ and also for the static case. It is clear that the lead
time syndrome can be very disruptive, and can lead to a high total
cost when there is a high frequency of updating. In such cases, it
may even be beneﬁcial to use static lead times. The ﬁgure also suggests that, in the dynamic case, if there exists a higher tendency for
responding to changes in the lead time (i.e., larger ˇ), then, in order
to maintain and control the total cost, the update frequency must
be decreased because this will smoothen the disruptive effects of
In this paper, an effective lead time quoting procedure is proposed for a pull production control system. The existence of the
lead time syndrome has well been proven in the literature, and the

concept played a central role in the problem setting considered in
this paper. Valuable insights are provided for the impacts of various
design and environmental parameters such as update frequency,
response probability, the number of kanbans, utilization and cost
parameters. The relative improvement by the dynamic lead time
setting procedure over the static lead time has been shown through
The main insights gathered from our quantitative results are:
1 Dynamically updating the lead times performs much better than
the static lead times. The relative improvement is higher when
the production system operates under a higher utilization level.
2 As the lead time syndrome strengthens through larger response
probability, the performance degrades with higher costs and
3 Update frequency can be used as a ﬁne tuning parameter to make
the lead time quoting procedure ﬂexible against changing environment. Once the lead time syndrome exists in a higher degree
(larger ˇ) or the lead time costs are high, the lead time quoting
procedure should be adapted by decreasing the update frequency
in order to smooth the effects of the lead time syndrome.
We suggest any future research of this study should consider
a larger problem set including a multi-stage production system
together with a downstream distribution system into the evaluation. Although the problem complexity may easily become very
high and may limit achieving closed form solutions, we believe
valuable insights remain to be explored about such informationfeedback systems within a supply chain context.
