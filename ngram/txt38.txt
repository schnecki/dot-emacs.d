The nature of manufacturing systems faces ever more complex,
dynamic and at times even chaotic behaviors. In order to being able
to satisfy the demand for high-quality products in an efficient manner,
it is essential to utilize all means available. One area, which saw fast
pace developments in terms of not only promising results but also
usability, is machine learning. Promising an answer to many of the
old and new challenges of manufacturing, machine learning is widely
discussed by researchers and practitioners alike. However, the field
is very broad and even confusing which presents a challenge and a
barrier hindering wide application. Here, this paper contributes in
presenting an overview of available machine learning techniques
and structuring this rather complicated area. A special focus is laid
on the potential benefit, and examples of successful applications in
The manufacturing industry today is experiencing a never seen increase in available data
(Chand & Davis, 2010). These data compromise a variety of different formats, semantics, quality, e.g. sensor data from the production line, environmental data, machine tool
parameters, etc. (Davis et al., 2015). Different names are used for this phenomenon, e.g.
Industrie 4.0 (Germany), Smart Manufacturing (USA), and Smart Factory (South Korea).
This increase and availability of large amounts of data is often referred to as Big Data (Lee,
Lapira, Bagheri, & Kao, 2013). The availability of, e.g. quality-related data offers potential to
improve process and product quality sustainably (Elangovan, Sakthivel, Saravanamurugan,
Nair, & Sugumaran, 2015). However, it has been recognized that much information can also
propose a challenge and may have a negative impact as it can, e.g. distract from the main
issues/causalities or lead to delayed or wrong conclusions about appropriate actions (Lang,
2007). Overall, it can be safely concluded, the manufacturing industry has to accept that in
order to benefit from the increased data availability, e.g. for quality improvement initiatives,

manufacturing cost estimation and/or process optimization, better understanding of the
customer’s requirements, etc., support is needed to handle the high dimensionality, complexity, and dynamics involved (Davis et al., 2015; Loyer, Henriques, Fontul, & Wiseall,
New developments in certain domains like mathematics and computer science (e.g. statistical learning) and availability of easy-to-use, often freely available (software) tools offer
great potential to transform the manufacturing domain and their grasp on the increased
manufacturing data repositories sustainably. One of the most exciting developments is in
the area of machine learning (incl. data mining (DM), artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge
discovery (KD) from databases, etc.). However, the field of machine learning is very diverse
and many different algorithms, theories, and methods are available. For many manufacturing practitioners, this represents a barrier regarding the adoption of these powerful tools
and thus may hinder the utilization of the vast amounts of data increasingly being available.
In accordance to that, the paper aims to:
• argue from a manufacturing perspective why machine learning is an appropriate and
promising tool for today’s and future challenges;
• introduce the terminology used in the respective fields;
• present an overview of the different areas of machine learning and propose an overall
• provide the reader with a high-level understanding of the advantages and disadvantages
of certain methods with respect to manufacturing application.
In the following section, the current challenges manufacturing faces are illustrated. This
provides a basis for the later argumentation of machine learning being an appropriate tool
to for manufacturers to face those challenges head on.
1.1. Challenges of the manufacturing domain
Manufacturing is a very established industry, however the importance of it cannot be rated
high enough. Several mature economies experienced a reduction of the manufacturing
contribution toward their GDP over the last decades. However, in the last years, several
initiatives to revamp the manufacturing sector were started. Examples are the US through
‘Executive Actions to Strengthen Advanced Manufacturing in America’ (White House,
2014) and the European Union with their ‘Factories of the Future’ (European Commission,
2016) initiative. The challenges manufacturing faces today are different from the challenges
There are several studies available proposing key challenges of manufacturing on a global
level. The key challenges most of the researchers agree upon (Dingli, 2012; Gordon & Sohal,
2001; Shiang & Nagaraj, 2011; Thomas, Byard, & Evans, 2012) are the following:
• Adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies.
• Growing importance of manufacturing of high value-added products.
• Utilizing advanced knowledge, information management, and AI systems.
• Sustainable manufacturing (processes) and products.
• Agile and flexible enterprise capabilities and supply chains.
• Innovation in products, services, and processes.

Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
• Close collaboration between industry and research to adopt new technologies.
• New manufacturing management paradigms.
These key challenges highlight the ongoing trend of the manufacturing domain to becoming more complex and dynamic. The apparent complexity is inherited not only in the
manufacturing programs themselves but increasingly in the to-be-manufactured product as
well as in the (business) processes of the companies and collaborative networks (Wiendahl
& Scholtissek, 1994). Adding to the challenge is the fact that the dynamic business environment of today’s manufacturing companies is affected by uncertainty (Monostori, 2003).
Especially looking at domains most likely to being optimized, e.g. monitoring and control,
scheduling and diagnostics, it becomes apparent that the increasing availability of data is
adding another challenge: besides the large amounts of available date (e.g. sensor data), the
high dimensionality and variety (e.g. due to different sensors or connected processes) of
data as well as the NP complete nature of manufacturing optimization problems (Wuest,
To overcome some of today’s major challenges of complex manufacturing systems, valid
candidates are machine learning techniques. These data-driven approaches are able to find
highly complex and non-linear patterns in data of different types and sources and transform raw data to features spaces, so-called models, which are then applied for prediction,
detection, classification, regression, or forecasting.
In the following, first the main advantages and challenges of machine learning applications with regard to manufacturing, its challenges and requirements are illustrated. Then
the current state of the art of machine learning, again with a focus on manufacturing
applications is presented. Within that context, a structuring of different machine learning
techniques and algorithms is developed and presented.
1.2. Suitability of machine learning application with regard to today’s
Before looking into the suitability of machine learning (ML) based on the previously derived
requirements toward a future solution approach, the used terms are briefly introduced. ML
is known for its ability to handle many problems of NP-complete nature, which often appear
in the domain of smart manufacturing (Monostori, Hornyák, Egresits, & Viharos, 1998).
The application of ML techniques increased over the last two decades due to various
factors, e.g. the availability of large amounts of complex data with little transparency (Smola
& Vishwanathan, 2008) and the increased usability and power of available ML tools (Larose,
2005). Nevertheless, the main definition of ML, allowing computers to solve problems
without being specifically programmed to do so (Samuel, 1959) is still valid today. ML
is connected to other terms, like DM, KD, AI, and others (Alpaydin, 2010). Today, ML is
already widely applied in different areas of manufacturing, e.g. optimization, control, and
troubleshooting (Alpaydin, 2010; Pham & Afify, 2005).
Many ML techniques (e.g. Support Vector Machine [SVM]) are designed to analyze large
amounts of data and capable of handling high dimensionality (>1000) very well (Yang &
Trewn, 2004). However, accompanying issues like possible over-fitting has to be considered
(Widodo & Yang, 2007) during the application. If dimensionality proves to be an issue
despite it being unlikely due to the power of the algorithms, there are methods available to
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
reduce the dimensions. These claim to reduce the impact of the reduction of the dimensionality on the expected results (Kotsiantis, 2007; Manning, Raghavan, & Schütze, 2009).
The importance of using ML, in this case SVM is that dimensionality is not a practical
problem and therefore the need for reducing dimensionality is reduced. This implies the
possibility of being more liberal in including seemingly irrelevant information available in
the manufacturing data that may turn out to be relevant under certain circumstances. This
may have a direct effect on the existing knowledge gap described previously (Alpaydin,
Applying ML in manufacturing may result in deriving pattern from existing data-sets,
which can provide a basis for the development of approximations about future behavior
of the system (Alpaydin, 2010; Nilsson, 2005). This new information (knowledge) may
support process owners in their decision-making or be used automatically to improve the
system directly. In the end, the goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns
or regularities that describe relations (Alpaydin, 2010).
Given the challenge of a fast changing, dynamic manufacturing environment, ML, being
part of AI and inherit the ability to learn and adapt to changes ‘the system designer need
not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations’ (Alpaydin, 2010). Therefore,
ML provides a strong argument why its application in manufacturing may be beneficial
given the struggle of most first-principle models to cope with the adaptability. Learning
from and adapting to changing environments automatically is a major strength of ML (Lu,
ML techniques are designed to derive knowledge out of existing data (Alpaydin, 2010;
Kwak & Kim, 2012). Alpaydin (2010) emphasizes that ‘stored data becomes useful only when
it is analyzed and turned into information that we can make use of, for example, to make
predictions’ (Alpaydin, 2010). This is especially true for manufacturing, given the struggle
of obtaining real-time data during a live manufacturing program run with the technical,
financial, and knowledge restrictions. This may also have an impact on issue of positioning
of process checkpoints (Wuest, Liu, Lu, & Thoben, 2014). Whereas, it makes sense to select
carefully checkpoints under the perspective of what data are useful, it may be obsolete given
the analytical power of ML techniques to derive information from formerly considered useless data. This may result in the ability to determine more states, to capture data, along the
overall manufacturing program. Whether this is beneficial is an open question, which has
to be researched. Given the ability of ML to handle high-dimensionality data, the technical
side of analyzing the additional data provides no problem. However, in terms of capturing
data it may still be a problem, specifically the ability to capture the data. Once the data are
available, determining state drivers in very high-dimensionality situations is not considered
problematic, nor is repeating it frequently.
In the following table, a summary of the theoretical ability of ML techniques to answer
the main challenges of manufacturing applications (requirements) is presented (Table 1).
Overall, as Monostori, Márkus, Van Brussel, and Westkämper (1996) emphasize, ‘intelligence is strongly connected with learning, and learning ability must be an indispensable
feature of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems.’ ML provides strong arguments when it comes
to the limitations and challenges the theoretical product state concept faces. Given the abovestated analysis, ML techniques seem to provide a promising solution based on the derived
requirements. Most of the identified requirements are successfully addressed by ML.

However, a more detailed analysis of available ML techniques as well as their strengths
and limitations concerning the requirements has to be provided. Most of all, the possible
compatibility with the theoretical product state concept and its perspective on the manufacturing program has to be elaborated further before a final judgment can be given.
Furthermore, there are many questions to be answered like how ML techniques may handle
In the next section, the advantages and challenges of machine learning application in
manufacturing are introduced based on the previous presented requirements.
2. Advantages and challenges of machine learning application in
ML has been successfully utilized in various process optimization, monitoring and control
applications in manufacturing, and predictive maintenance in different industries (Alpaydin,
2010; Gardner & Bicker, 2000; Kwak & Kim, 2012; Pham & Afify, 2005; Susto, Schirru,
Pampuri, McLoone, & Beghi, 2015). ML techniques were found to provide promising potential for improved quality control optimization in manufacturing systems (Apte, Weiss, &
Grout, 1993), especially in ‘complex manufacturing environments where detection of the
causes of problems is difficult’ (Harding, Shahbaz, & Kusiak, 2006). However, often ML
applications are found to be limited focusing on specific processes instead of the whole
manufacturing program or manufacturing system (Doltsinis, Ferreira, & Lohse, 2012).
There are many different ML methods, tools, and techniques available, each with distinct
advantages and disadvantages. The domain of ML has grown to an independent research
domain. Therefore, within this section, the goal is to find a suitable ML technique for

2.1. Advantages of machine learning application in manufacturing
The general advantages of ML have been established in previous sections stating that ML
techniques are able to handle NP complete problems which often occur when it comes to
optimization problems of intelligent manufacturing systems (Monostori et al., 1998). In
the following, the focus is on the ability of ML techniques to handle high-dimensional,
multi-variate data, and the ability to extract implicit relationships within large data-sets in
a complex and dynamic, often even chaotic environment (Köksal, Batmaz, & Testik, 2011;
Yang & Trewn, 2004). ‘Since most engineering and manufacturing problems are data-rich
but knowledge-sparse’ (Lu, 1990), ML provides a tool to increase the understanding of the
domain. In this section, the advantages are presented in an attempt of generalization for
ML in total. However, it has to be understood, that the peculiarity of the advantages may
differ depending on the chosen ML technique.
Overall it is agreed upon that ML allows to reduce cycle time and scrap, and improve
resource utilization in certain NP-hard manufacturing problems. Furthermore, ML provides
powerful tools for continuous quality improvement in a large and complex process such as
semiconductor manufacturing (Monostori et al., 1998; Pham & Afify, 2005).
An advantage of ML algorithms is the ability to handle high dimensional problems and
data. Especially with regard to the increasing availability of complex data (Yu & Liu, 2003)
with little transparency in manufacturing (Smola & Vishwanathan, 2008), this will most
likely become even more important in the future. However, as is true for most advantages
and disadvantages of ML algorithms, this cannot be generalized. Some algorithms (e.g. SVM;
Distributed Hierarchical Decision Tree) can handle high dimensionality better than others
(Bar-Or, Wolff, Schuster, & Keren, 2005; Do, Lenca, Lallich, & Pham, 2010). As was stated
previously, in manufacturing mostly those ML algorithms are applicable that are capable
of handling high-dimensional data. Therefore, the ability to cope with high dimensionality
is considered an advantage of ML application in manufacturing.
Another advantage of ML techniques is the increased usability of application of algorithms
due to (often source) programs like Rapidminer. This allows (relatively) easy application in
many cases and furthermore comfortable adjustment of parameters to increase the classification performance.
As previously stated, a major advantage of ML algorithms is to discover formerly unknown
(implicit) knowledge and to identify implicit relationships in data-sets. Depending on the
characteristic of the ML algorithm (supervised/unsupervised or Reinforcement Learning
[RL]), the requirements toward the available data may vary. However, the overall ability of
ML algorithm to achieve results in a manufacturing environment was successfully proven
(e.g. Alpaydin, 2010; Filipic & Junkar, 2000; Guo, Sun, Li, & Wang, 2008; Kim, Kang, Cho,
Given the specific nature of manufacturing systems being dynamic, uncertain, and complex. Here, ML algorithms provide the opportunity to learn from the dynamic system and
adapt to the changing environment automatically to a certain extent (Lu, 1990; Simon,
1983). The adaptation is, depending on the ML algorithm, reasonably fast and in almost
all cases faster than traditional methods.

Applying ML in manufacturing may result in deriving pattern from existing data-sets,
which can provide a basis for the development of approximations about future behavior
of the system (Alpaydin, 2010; Nilsson, 2005). This new information (knowledge) may
support process owners in their decision-making or used to automatically improve the
system directly. In the end, the goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns
or regularities that describe relations (Alpaydin, 2010).
Kotsiantis (2007) compared several algorithms according to their specific performance
in manufacturing application by different attributes. Even so, this presents the opportunity
to get a first impression, it is not suggested to base the decision for a suitable ML algorithm
solely on comparisons as presented in such a table. Each problem is different and the performance of each algorithm also depends on the data available and data pre-processing as
well as the parameter settings. The best fitting algorithm has to be found in testing various
ones in a realistic environment. This is discussed further in the next section.
2.2. Challenges of machine learning application in manufacturing
A very common challenge of ML application in manufacturing is the acquisition of relevant
data. This is also a limitation as the availability, quality, and composition (e.g. are meta-data
included? are data labeled?) of the manufacturing data at hand have a strong influence on the
performance of ML algorithms. Some challenges the data-set can contain are, e.g. high-dimensional data can represent for some ML algorithms, that is, it can contain a high degree
of irrelevant and redundant information which may impact the performance of learning
algorithms (Yu & Liu, 2003). Today, most machine learning techniques handle only data
with continuous and nominal values (Pham & Afify, 2005). How significant the influence
is, depends on various factors including the algorithm itself and the parameter settings. It
can be considered a general challenge for most research in manufacturing and not only ML
application, to get hold of any data due to, e.g. security concerns or a basic lack of data capturing during the process. Even though in most cases ML allows the extracting of knowledge
and generates better results than most traditional methods with less requirements toward
available data, certain aspects concerning the available data that can prevent the successful
application still have to be considered. Together with the next point, this highlights the
increased need to understand the data in order to apply ML. Hoffmann (1990) highlights
that compared to traditional methods where a lot of time is spent to extract information,
in ML a lot of time is spent on preparing the data.
After the available data are secured, the data often have to be pre-processed depending
on the requirements of the algorithm of choice. Pre-processing of data has a critical impact
on the results. However, there are many standardized tools available which support the
most common pre-processing processes like normalizing and filtering the data. Also it has
to be checked whether the training data are unbalanced. This can present a challenge for
the training of certain algorithms. In manufacturing practice, it is a common problem that
values of certain attributes are not available or missing in the data-set (Pham & Afify, 2005).
These so-called missing values present a challenge for the application of ML algorithms.
There are certain practical induction systems available which may fill the gap (Pham & Afify,
2005). However, each problem and later applied ML algorithm have specific requirements
when it comes to replacing missing values. By replacing missing values, the original data-set
is influenced. The goal is to reduce the bias and other negative influence as much as possible
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
in respect to the analysis goal. As this issue represents a very common challenge, there is a
large amount of literature and practical solutions (e.g. in R) available (e.g. Graham, 2012;
Kabacoff, 2011; Kwak & Kim, 2012; Li & Huang, 2009).
A major challenge of increasing importance is the question what ML technique and
algorithm to choose (selection of ML algorithm). Even so, there were attempts to pursue the
definition of ‘general ML techniques,’ the diverse problems and their requirements highlight
the need for specialized algorithms with certain strength and weaknesses (Hoffmann, 1990).
Especially due to the increased attention of practitioners and researchers for the field of
ML in manufacturing, a large number of different ML algorithms or at least variations of
ML algorithms is available. Adding to this already existing complexity, combinations of
different algorithms, so-called ‘hybrid approaches,’ are becoming more and more common
promising better results than ‘individual’ single algorithm application (e.g. Lee & Ha, 2009).
Many studies are available highlighting a successful application of ML techniques for specific
problems. At the same time the test data are not publically available in many cases. This
makes a neutral and unbiased assessment of the results and therefore a final comparison
challenging. As of today, the generally accepted approach to select a suitable ML algorithm
• First, one looks at the available data and how it is described (labeled, unlabeled, available expert knowledge, etc.) to choose between a supervised, unsupervised, or RL
• Secondly, the general applicability of available algorithms with regard to the research
problem requirements (e.g. able to handle high dimensionality) has to be analyzed.
A specific focus has to be laid on the structure, the data types, and overall amount of
the available data, which can be used for training and evaluation.
• Thirdly, previous applications of the algorithms on similar problems are to be investigated in order to identify a suitable algorithm. The term ‘similar’ in this case means,
research problems with comparable requirements e.g. in other disciplines or domains.
Another challenge is the interpretation of the results. It has to be taken into account that
not only the format or illustration of the output is relevant for the interpretation but also the
specifications of the chosen algorithm itself, the parameter settings, the ‘planed outcome’
and also the data including its pre-processing. Within the interpretation of the results, certain more distinct limitations (again depending on the chosen algorithm) can have a large
impact. Among those are, e.g. immune to over-fitting (Widodo & Yang, 2007), bias, and
variance (therefore bias–variance tradeoff) (Quadrianto & Buntine, 2011).
3. Structuring of machine leaning techniques and algorithms
As previously stated, ML has developed into a wide and divers field of research over the
past decades. This has led to a variety of different sub-domains, algorithms, theories, and
application areas, etc. The relationship and structure between the different elements are not
commonly agreed upon. Different researchers choose different approaches to structure the
field. In Figure 1, the authors try to structure the ML domain of DM according to tasks on
the one side and available algorithms on the other (Corne, Dhaenens, & Jourdan, 2012).
This structure highlights the importance of differentiation of task (what is the goal) and
algorithm (how can that goal be reached) within the ML field.
Production & Manufacturing Research: An Open Access Journal
However, the presented overview in Figure 1 is falling short by not reflecting the commonly accepted differentiation of ML methods by the available feedback in supervised,
unsupervised, and RL (Monostori, 1993; Kotsiantis, 2007; Monostori, 2003; Pham & Afify,
2005). Monostori (2003) described the three classes as follows:
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
• ‘reinforcement learning: less feedback is given, since not the proper action, but only
an evaluation of the chosen action is given by the teacher;
• unsupervised learning: no evaluation [label] of the action is provided, since there is
• supervised learning: the correct response [label] is provided by a teacher.’
This structure is widely accepted, however, there are still differences with regard to what
falls under them or what these three classes fall under. For example, Pham and Afify (2005)
map supervised, unsupervised, and RL as part of Neural Networks (NN) (see Figure 2).
However, Pham and Afify (2005) also state that they only focus on supervised classification
learning methods. This would correspond with Lu (1990) who states that inductive learning

Figure 2. Classification of main ML techniques according to Pham and Afify (2005).

can be grouped in supervised and unsupervised learning. Other researchers differentiate
between active and passive learning, stating that ‘active learning is generally used to refer
to a learning problem or system where the learner has some role in determining on what
data it will be trained’ (Cohn, 2011) whereas passive learning describes a situation where
the learner has no control over the training set. Apparently, active learning is often used for
problems where it is difficult (expensive and/or time-consuming) to obtain labeled training
data. The advantage is to being able to achieve good performance needing less training data
than other learners due to the sequentially identified useful examples by the active learner
(Cohn, 2011). Active learning is mostly applied within supervised ML scenarios but was
also found to be of valuable within certain RL problems (Cohn, 2011).
Some researchers like Kotsiantis (2007) focus only on supervised classification techniques
and group NN as a learning algorithm as part of supervised learning. However, NN algorithms can also be applied in unsupervised learning and RL (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1988;
Pham & Afify, 2005). This corresponds basically with Pham and Afify (2005), when the
notion on top of the hierarchy is seen as ‘Supervised ML’ instead of the ‘Machine learning’
An adapted and extended structuring of ML techniques and algorithms may be illustrated as follows:
Figure 3 does not include all available algorithms and algorithm variations. The purpose is
to show the complex structure and the diverse nature of currently available and common ML
techniques. Whereas the first selection of the main differentiation, supervised, unsupervised,
and RL, suitable for the presented problem is in most cases possible, this is not necessarily
the case when going further down the hierarchy. Additionally, it has to be kept in mind,
that the different algorithms can be combined to maximize the classification power (Bishop,
2006). Pham and Afify (2005) state that ‘most of the existing machine-learning methods
for generating multiple models can improve significantly on the accuracy of single models’
(Pham & Afify, 2005). That increases the complexity one has to face when in the process
of selecting a suitable ML algorithm for a given problem, and thus the comprehensibility
is hindered (Pham & Afify, 2005). Another interesting aspect is that many algorithms are
applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning (in adapted form).
The different algorithms and combinatory approaches often tend to be adapted to special problems. This makes it hard to compare them especially against their classification
power for the given problem. A first indication can be comparing charts as can be found
Figure 3. Structuring of ML techniques and algorithms.
Production & Manufacturing Research: An Open Access Journal

in Kotsiantis (2007). However, a more promising approach to select a suitable algorithm is
to look for problems of similar nature and analyze what ML algorithm was used to solve it
and what where the results. This is a good starting point. Once the algorithm is applied to
the problem and first results are available, different methods can be applied and the results
for the given problem can be compared. Modern computer tools support different kernels
and make the switch (relatively) comfortable.
In the following, unsupervised machine learning, RL, and supervised machine learning are briefly described to being able to differentiate them from one another. Supervised
machine learning later described in greater detail as it was found to have the best fit for
challenges and problems faced in manufacturing applications and as manufacturing data
is often labeled, meaning expert feedback is available (Lu, 1990).
Unsupervised machine learning is another large area of research. The defining attribute is
that within unsupervised learning, there is no feedback from an external teacher/knowledgeable expert. The algorithm itself is supposed to identify clusters from existing data based
on, e.g. conceptual cohesiveness of attributes (Lu, 1990). Kotsiantis (2007) introduced the
rule that if instances are unlabeled (no known labels and corresponding correct outputs),
it is most likely unsupervised learning. The goal is to discover unknown classes of items by
clustering (Jain, Murty, & Flynn, 1999) whereas supervised learning is focused on classification (known labels). Basically, unsupervised ML describes any ML process that tries to
learn ‘structure in the absence of either an identified output [e.g. supervised ML] or feedback
[e.g. RL]. Three typical examples of unsupervised learning are clustering, association rules,
and self-organizing maps’ (Sammut & Webb, 2011).
Especially in the Big Data context, unsupervised methods are becoming increasingly
important. However, as in manufacturing application, the main assumption is that knowledgeable experts can provide feedback on the classification of states to identify the learning
set in order to train the algorithm (Lu, 1990; Monostori, 2003). Thus, the focus will be laid
on supervised methods. However, some aspects of unsupervised learning may be beneficial in manufacturing application after all. First, there is the possibility that in some cases
there might be no expert feedback available or, in the future, desirable. Another aspect is to
realize hybrid approaches, combing the ‘best of both worlds’ which gain importance due to
the fast increase in unlabeled data especially in manufacturing (Kang, Kim, & Cho, 2016).
And finally, unsupervised methods can be and are being used to, e.g. identify outliers in
manufacturing data (Hansson, Yella, Dougherty, & Fleyeh, 2016).
RL is defined by the provision of the training information by the environment. The information on how well the system performed in the respective turn is provided by a numerical
reinforcement signal (Kotsiantis, 2007). Another defining characteristic is that the learner
has to uncover which actions generate the best results (numerical reinforcement signal)
by trying instead of being told. This distinguishes RL from most of the other ML methods
(Sutton & Barto, 2012). However, RL is seen by some researchers as ‘a special form of
supervised learning’ (Pham & Afify, 2005). However, different from supervised learning
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
problems, RL problems can be described by the absence of labeled examples of ‘good’ and
‘bad’ behavior (Stone, 2011). RL, based on sequential environmental response, emulates the
process of learning of humans (Wiering & Van Otterlo, 2012). This ‘reward signal,’ which
can be perceived in RL differentiates it from unsupervised ML (Stone, 2011). Different
from supervised learning, RL is most adequate in situation where there is no knowledgeable supervisor. In such uncharted territory, an agent is needed to being able to learn from
interaction and its own experience – this is where RL can utilize its advantages (Sutton &
As RL is based on feedback of actions, one interesting and also challenging issue is that
certain actions have not or not only an immediate impact, but certain effects might show
at a later time and/or during a following additional trial. Overall, RL ‘is defined not by
characterizing learning methods, but by characterizing a learning problem. Any method
that is well suited to solving that problem, [might be considered] to be a reinforcement
A very specific challenge for RL is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.
In order to achieve the goal, the agent has to ‘exploit’ the actions it learned to prefer and
to identify those it has to ‘explore’ by actively trying new ways (Sutton & Barto, 2012). In
manufacturing, RL is not widely applied and just a few examples of successful application
exist as of today (Doltsinis et al., 2012; Günther, Pilarski, Helfrich, Shen, & Diepold, 2015).
In the majority of manufacturing applications today, expert feedback is available. Therefore,
even though RL is applicable in manufacturing applications, the focus in the following is
In manufacturing application, supervised ML techniques are mostly applied due to the
data-rich but knowledge-sparse nature of the problems (Lu, 1990). In addition, supervised
ML may benefit from the established data collection in manufacturing for statistical process control purposes (Harding et al., 2006) and the fact that these data are mostly labeled.
Basically, supervised ML ‘is learning from examples provided by a knowledgeable external
supervisor’ (Sutton & Barto, 2012). This is partly due to the availability of (a) expert feedback
(e.g. quality) and (b) the labeled instances. Supervised ML is applied in different domains
of manufacturing, monitoring, and control being a very prominent one among them (e.g.
Alpaydin, 2010; Apte et al., 1993; Harding et al., 2006; Kwak & Kim, 2012; Pham & Afify,
The general process of supervised ML contains several steps handling the data and setting
up the training and test data-set by the teacher, hence supervised (Kotsiantis, 2007). Based
on a given problem, the required data are identified and (if needed) pre-processed. An
important aspect is the definition of the training set, as it influences the later classification
results to a large extent. Even so it often appears as if the algorithm selection is always following the definition of the training data-set, the definition of the training data also has to
take the requirements of the algorithm selection into account. Some algorithms allow for a
so-called ‘kernel selection’ to adapt the algorithm to the specific nature of the problem. This
highlights the adaptability of ML application and the variety of problems that can be tackled.
Similar requirements stand to some extent also true for the identification and pre-­processing
of the data as different algorithms have certain strength and weaknesses concerning the
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
Production & Manufacturing Research: An Open Access Journal
handling of different data-sets (e.g. format, dimensions, etc.). After an algorithm is selected,
it is trained using the training data-set. In order to judge the ability to perform the targeted
task, the trained algorithm is then evaluated using the evaluations data-set. Depending on
the performance of the trained algorithm with the evaluation data-set, the parameters can
be adjusted to optimize the performance in the case the performance is already good. In
case the performance is not satisfying, the process has to be started over at an earlier stage,
A rule of thumb is that 70% of the data-set is used as a training data-set, 20% as an evaluation data-set (in order to adjust the parameters – e.g. bias) and final 10% as a test data-set.
In the following section, supervised learning algorithms are illustrated in more detail as
they are the most commonly used algorithms in manufacturing application today. A major
reason being the availability of ‘labels’ based on quality inspections in many manufacturing
4. Supervised machine learning algorithms in manufacturing application
As can be seen in the previously presented figures, there are several supervised ML algorithms available. Each of these algorithms has specific advantages and limitations concerning
the application in manufacturing. A major challenge is to select a suitable algorithm for the
requirements of the manufacturing research problem at hand. First, the general applicability
of a ML algorithm with the requirements may be derived from more general comparisons
(e.g. presented by Kotsiantis (2007)). However, due to the individual nature, most research
problems represent the specific characteristics of ML algorithms as well as their adapted
‘siblings,’ it is not advisable to base the decision for a ML algorithm solely on such a theoretical and general selection. In order to being able to identify a suitable ML algorithm for
the problem at hand, the next step involves a careful analysis of previous applications of ML
algorithms on research problems with similar requirements. The research problems do not
have to be located within the same domain, the major issue in this selection is the matching
of the identified requirements, in this case the ability to handle multi-variate, high-dimensional data-sets and the ability to continuously adapt to changing environments (updating
the learning set). A brief presentation of the main advantages and limitations of the different
ML algorithms is presented in order to pre-select a group of potentially suitable techniques.
A very promising and fitting supervised ML algorithm for manufacturing research problem is Statistical Learning Theory (SLT). Within the theory of supervised learning, meaning
the training of a machine to enable it (without being explicitly programmed) to choose
a (performing) function describing the relation between inputs and output (Evgeniou,
Pontil, & Poggio, 2000). SLT focuses on the question of ‘how well the chosen function
generalizes, or how well it estimates the output for previously unseen inputs’ (Evgeniou
et al., 2000). Several more practical algorithms are based on the theoretical background of
SLT, e.g. NNs, SVMs, and Bayesian modeling (Brunato & Battiti, 2005). A major advantage
of SLT algorithms is the variety of possible application scenarios and possible application
strategies (Evgeniou, Poggio, Pontil, & Verri, 2002). SLT allows to reduce the number of
needed samples in certain cases (Koltchinskii, Abdallah, Ariola, & Dorato, 2001). SLT is
also able to overcome issues like observer variability better than other methods (Margolis,
Land, Gottlieb, & Qiao, 2011). In some other cases, SLT still needs a large number of
samples to perform (Cherkassky & Ma, 2009; Koltchinskii et al., 2001). Another challenge
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
for the application of SLT is the likelihood of over-fitting in some realizations (Evgeniou
et al., 2002). However, Steel (2011) found that the Vapnik–Chernovnenkis dimension is a
good predictor for the chance of over-fitting using STL. Furthermore, the computational
complexity is not eliminated using SLT but rather avoided by relaxing design questions
Bayesian Networks (BNs) may be defined as a graphical model describing the probability
relationship among several variables (Kotsiantis, 2007). BNs are among the most well-known
applications of SLT (Brunato & Battiti, 2005). Naïve Bayesian Networks represent a rather
simple form of BNs, being composed of directed acyclic graphs (one parent, multiple children) (Kotsiantis, 2007). Among the advantages of BN are the limited storage requirements,
the possibility to use it as an incremental learner, its robustness to missing values, and the
easiness to grasp output. However, the tolerance toward redundant and interdependent
attributes is understood to be very limited (Kotsiantis, 2007).
Instance-Based Learning (IBL) (Kang & Cho, 2008; Okamoto & Yugami, 2003) or
Memory-Based Reasoning (MBR) (Kang & Cho, 2008) are mostly based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers and applied in, e.g. regression and classification (Kang & Cho, 2008).
Even though IBL/MBR techniques have proven to achieve high accuracy of classification
in some cases (Akay, 2011), a stable and good performance (Gagliardi, 2011; Zheng, Li, &
Wang, 2010) and were found to be applicable in many different domains (Dutt & Gonzalez,
2012), when looking at the previously identified requirements they seem not to be the best
match. Reasons why IBL/MBR are excluded from further investigation are, among other
things, their difficulty to set the attribute weight vector in little known domains (Hickey &
Martin, 2001), the complicated calculations needed if large numbers of training instances/
test patterns and attributes are involved (Kang & Cho, 2008; Okamoto & Yugami, 2003),
less adaptable learning procedures (tends to over-fitting with noisy data) (Gagliardi, 2011),
task-dependency (Dutt & Gonzalez, 2012; Gonzalez, Dutt, & Lebiere, 2013), and time-sensitive to complexity (Gonzalez et al., 2013).
NN or Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by the functionality of the brain. The
brain is capable of performing impressive tasks (e.g. vision, speech recognition), tasks that
may proof beneficial in engineering application when transferred to a machine/artificial
system (Alpaydin, 2010). NN simulate the decentralized ‘computation’ of the central nervous system by parallel processing (in reality or simulated) and allow an artificial system
to perform unsupervised, reinforcement, and supervised learning tasks (e.g. pattern recognition) (Corne et al., 2012; Pham & Afify, 2005). Decentralization makes use of a high
‘number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements or nodes and incorporates
the ability to process information by a dynamic response of these nodes and their connections to external inputs’ (Cook, Zobel, & Wolfe, 2006). These NN play an important role
in today’s ML research (Nilsson, 2005). Today’s application of NN can be seen as being on
the representation and algorithm level (Alpaydin, 2010). NN are applied in various fields
of manufacturing (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing) and diverse problems (e.g. process
control) (Harding et al., 2006; Lee & Ha, 2009; Wang, Chen, & Lin, 2005) which highlights
their main advantage: their wide applicability (Pham & Afify, 2005). Besides the wide applicability, NN are capable of handling high-dimensional and multi-variate data on a similar
rate to the later introduced SVM (Kotsiantis, 2007). Manallack and Livingstone (1999)
found NN to ‘offer high accuracy in most cases but can suffer from over-ﬁtting the training
data’ (Manallack & Livingstone, 1999). However, in order to achieve the high accuracy, a
Downloaded by [Universitaetsbibliothek Innsbruck] at 12:01 31 October 2017
Production & Manufacturing Research: An Open Access Journal
large sample size is required by NN (similar to SVM) (Kotsiantis, 2007). Over-fitting, connected to the high-variance algorithms is commonly accepted as a drawback of NN (again
partly similar to SVMs) (Kotsiantis, 2007). Other challenges of applying NN include the
complexity of the models they produce, the intolerance concerning missing values and the
(often) time-consuming training (Kotsiantis, 2007; Pham & Afify, 2005).
The previously described SLT builds the theoretical foundation of a rather new and very
promising ML algorithm that attracts increasing attention in recent years due to its generally
high performance, ability to achieve high accuracy, and ability to handle high-dimensional,
multi-variate data-sets – SVM. SVMs were introduced by Cortes and Vapnik (1995) as a
new machine learning technique for two-group classification problems. Burbidge, Trotter,
Buxton, and Holden (2001) found SVM to be a ‘robust and highly accurate intelligent
classification technique well suited for structure–activity relationship analysis.’ SVM can be
understood as a practical methodology of the theoretical framework of STL (Cherkassky
& Ma, 2009). SVMs have a proven track record for successfully dealing with non-linear
problems (Li, Liang, & Xu, 2009). The idea behind it is that input vectors are non-linearly
mapped to a very high-dimensional feature space (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995). SVM can be
combined with different kernels and thus adapt to different circumstances/requirements
(e.g. NNs; Gaussian) (Keerthi & Lin, 2003). SVM as a classification technique has its roots
in SLT (Khemchandani & Chandra, 2009; Salahshoor, Kordestani, & Khoshro, 2010) and
has shown promising empirical results in a number of practical manufacturing applications
(Chinnam, 2002; Widodo & Yang, 2007) and works very well with high-dimensional data
(Azadeh et al., 2013; Ben-hur & Weston, 2010; Salahshoor et al., 2010; Sun, Rahman, Wong,
& Hong, 2004; Wu, 2010; Wuest, Irgens, & Thoben, 2014). Current literature suggests that
the performance of SVM compared to other ML methods is still very competitive (Jurkovic,
Cukor, Brezocnik, & Brajkovic, 2016).Another aspect of this approach is that it represents
the decision boundary using a subset of the training examples, known as the support vectors.
Ensemble Methods are a class of machine learning algorithms that combine a weighted
committee of learners to solve a classification or regression problem. The committee or
ensemble contains a number of base learners like NNs, trees, or nearest neighbor (Dietterich,
2000; Opitz & Maclin, 1999). In many cases, the base learners are from the same algorithm
family, which is called a homogeneous ensemble. In contrast to that, a heterogeneous example is constructed by combining base learners of different types. For many machine learning problems, it is demonstrated that the ensemble leads to a better model generalization
compared to a single base classifier (Zhou, 2012).
To construct the base classifiers, two main paradigms have demonstrated their predictive
power. On the one hand, sequential ensemble methods use the output from a base classifier
as an input of the following base classifier and therefore boost the output in a sequential
way. AdaBoost, introduced by Freund and Schapire (1995), is a well-known example, where
simple decision stumps are combined toward a complex boosting cascade. On the other
hand, parallel adjustment of base classifiers leads to independent models, which is also
named Bagging. One famous example of bagging methods is Random Forest (Breiman,
2001), which is a combination of randomly sampled tree predictors. In a first step, Random
forest randomly selects a subset of the features space, and then performs a conventional
split selection procedure within the selected feature subset.
Deep Machine Learning is a new area of machine learning that allows the processing of data
in multiple processing layers toward highly non-linear and complex feature representations.

The field is mainly driven by the computer vision and language processing domain (LeCun,
Bengio, & Hinton, 2015) but offers great potential to also boost data-driven manufacturing applications. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated
outstanding prediction performance in various fields of computer vision and won several
contests, e.g. (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012). In contrast to standard NNs, where
each neuron from layer n is connected to all neurons in layer (n − 1), a ConvNet is constructed by multiple filter stages with a restricted view and therefore well suited for image,
video, and volumetric data (LeCun et al., 1989). From layer to layer, a ConvNet transforms
the output of the previous layer in a higher abstraction by applying non-linear activation.
In manufacturing scenarios, data streams or data with temporal behavior are of major
importance. Especially deep recurrent neural nets have demonstrated the ability to model
temporal patterns, e.g. in time series data. Here, an important concept is the Long–ShortTerm Memory Model which is a more general architecture of deep NNs (Hochreiter &
5. Application areas of supervised machine learning in manufacturing
As was illustrated in the previous section, there is a wide variety of different ML algorithms
available. Each of them has specific advantages and disadvantages. In order to give an overview of successful applications of ML in manufacturing systems, selected applications of an
exemplary supervised machine learning algorithm, SVMs, are illustrated.
A major application area of SVM in manufacturing is monitoring (Chinnam, 2002).
Especially tool/machine condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and tool wear are domains
where SVM is continuously and successfully applied (Azadeh et al., 2013; Salahshoor et al.,
2010; Sun et al., 2004; Widodo & Yang, 2007). Also quality monitoring in manufacturing
is a field where SVMs were successfully applied (Ribeiro, 2005).
An application area of SVM with an overlap to manufacturing application is image recognition (e.g. character and face recognition) (Salahshoor et al., 2010; Widodo & Yang, 2007;
Wu, 2010). In manufacturing, this can be utilized to identify (classify) damaged products
(e.g. surface roughness) (Çaydaş & Ekici, 2010). Other application areas are, e.g. handwriting classification (Scheidat, Leich, Alexander, & Vielhauer, 2009). Time series forecasting is
also a domain where SVM optimization is often applied (Guo et al., 2008; Salahshoor et al.,
Besides manufacturing and image recognition, SVMs are often used within the medicine domain. Among the many areas of application within this domain, the use of SVM
in cancer research is standing out (Furey et al., 2000; Guyon, Weston, Barnhill, & Vapnik,
2002; Rejani & Selvi, 2009). Other medical application areas are, e.g. drug design (Burbidge
et al., 2001) and detection of microcalcifications (El-naqa, Yang, Wernick, Galatsanos, &
Further application areas include but are not limited to credit rating (Huang, Chen, Hsu,
Chen, & Wu, 2004), food quality control (Borin, Ferrão, Mello, Maretto, & Poppi, 2006),
classification of polymers (Li et al., 2009), and rule extraction (Martens, Baesens, Van Gestel,
& Vanthienen, 2007). These examples from various industries and optimization problems
highlight the wide applicability and adaptability of the SVM algorithm.

In this paper, first the challenges of modern manufacturing systems, e.g. increasing complexity, dynamic, high dimensionality, and chaotic structures are highlighted. Following,
machine learning limitations and advantages from a manufacturing perspective were discussed before a structuring of the diverse field of machine learning is proposed and an
overview of the basic terminology of this inter-disciplinary field is presented. The structure
is distinguishing unsupervised machine learning, RL, and supervised machine learning
as a possible way to group the available algorithms and applications. It was argued that
supervised learning is a good fit for most manufacturing applications due to the fact that
the majority of manufacturing applications can provide labeled data. Based on this distinction, the most commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms are presented.
Thereafter, an exemplary illustration of successful application in manufacturing of the
supervised machine learning algorithm SVMs is presented. This overview highlights the
adaptability and variety of usage opportunities in the field.
With fast paced developments in the area of algorithms and increasing availability of
data (e.g. due to low cost sensors and the shift toward smart manufacturing) and computing power, the applications for machine learning especially in manufacturing will increase
further at a rapid pace. As of today, supervised algorithms have the upper hand in most
application in the manufacturing domain. However, with the fast increase in available data,
thanks to more and better sensor technologies and increased awareness, unsupervised
methods (including RL) may increase in importance in the future. Already today, hybrid
approaches are being used that offer ‘the best of both worlds.’ This corresponds with the
attention the Big Data developments received in recent years. Concluding, it can be said with
confidence, ML is already a powerful tool for many applications within (intelligent) manufacturing systems and smart manufacturing and its importance will increase further in the
future. Its interdisciplinary nature presents a big opportunity but also a significant risk at the
same time as collaboration between different disciplines, like Computer Science, Industrial
Engineering, Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering is necessary to drive progress.
No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.
