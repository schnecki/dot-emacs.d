The major perf ormance measurements for waf er f abrication system comprise
WIP level, throughput and cycle time. These measurements are in¯ uenced by
various f actors, including machine breakdown, operator absence, poor dispatching rules, emergency order and material shortage. Generally, production managers use the WIP level pro® le of each stage to identify an abnormal situation,
and then make corrective actions. However, such a measurement is reactive, not
proactive. Proactive actions must e ectively predict the future performance, analyze the abnormal situation, and then generate corrective actions to prevent perf ormance f rom degrading. This work systematically constructs arti® cial neural
network models to predict production perf ormances f or a semiconductor manuf acturing factory. A n application f or a local DR AM waf er fabrication has
demonstrated the accuracy of neural network models in predicting production
Three major performance measurements in a wafer fabrication consist of the
WIP level, throughpu t (move volume) and cycle time. The relationship s among
these performance measurements and the disturbanc e factors (e.g. machine breakdown, material shortage and emergency order) are quite complicated. For instance,
machine breakdow n may increase the WIP level, prolong the cycle time, and thereby
in¯ uence the throughpu t of the downstream stages even further. A circumstance in
which disturbanc e events occur daily poses di culty for the production manager to
maintain system performance. Therefore, the undesirable e ects must be known in
advance so that the proper corrective actions can be taken to prevent degrading
performance. In practice, production managers use the WIP level pro® le of each
operation stage to identify an abnormal situation and make necessary correcting
actions. Such a measurement is reactive, not proactive. A proactive way must predict
the future performance, identify and analyze an abnormal situation , and then generate necessary corrective actions to prevent abnormal performance decreasing.
Several models, includin g simulation , queueing, spreadsheet, regression and
neural networks, can be employed to predict production performance. Of these,

simulation , regression and neural networks are the most widely used. In order to
build a simulation model to predict and control the performance of a system subject
to disturbances, the characteristics of these disturbances must ® rst be estimated and
used as input variables. Then by introducing changes in these characteristics their
e ect on the system performances (output variable) can be methodically evaluated.
However, considering all the system disturbances in one simulation model is extremely di cult. Moreover, detailed simulation s require an enormous amount of
time and money to write and maintain, especially in the semiconductor manufacturing environment; in addition , several hours are necessary to run them even on a
powerful computer (Connors et al. 1996 ) . Besides this, the accuracy in predicting
wafer fabricatio n performance with simulation model still remains questionable due
Multiple regression is a general statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between a single dependent (predicted ) variabl e and several independen t ones
(predictors) . Multiple linear regression produces a linear approximation to ® t the
data. Variable transformation allows, to some extent, the linear regression methods
to handle nonlinea r cases. However, such a transformation may make it di cult to
interpret the results. We could always ® nd a polynomial of a higher degree that
would yield a perfect ® t to a speci® ed data set. Thus, this results in over® tting and
an inabilit y of the regression model to generalize (Shyur et al. 1996 ) .
Neural networks are becoming more and more well known, and have been
successfully implemented in manufacturing (Udo 1992, Zhang and Huang 1995 ) .
For instance, Philipoo m et al. (1994 ) using neural network models, forecast the
order due-date in a ¯ ow shop manufacturing system. The neural network model
yielded better forecasting results than conventiona l due-date assignment approache s
Using historical data as the input variables, the regression model and neural
network model can represent the properties and variation s of a system. When a
system is stable, acceptable forecasting accuracy using the two models is expected.
However, ® nding a nonlinea r regression model that can correspond to the historical
data and represent the system’ s status is di cult. Many independen t variables must
be considered in our case. Furthermore, some of the data do not ® t the basic
assumptions of regression models. Thus, additiona l data transformations are necessary to generate our regression model. A lternatively , creating neural network models
does not have the above conditions . Moreover, in practice, neural network models
can yield better results than regression models (Philipoo m et al. 1994, Shyur et al.
1996 ) . Using the neural network models to predict wafer fabrication’ s production

selected as the input variables in our BPN model. A systematic construction procedure is presented in the third section.
Neural networks are computing systems that incorporat e a simpli® ed model of
the human neuron, organized into networks similar to those found in the human
brain. A rti® cial neural networks are computer simulations of biologica l neurons.
Neural networks are composed of processing elements (nodes) and connections.
Each processing element has an output signal that fans out along the connections
to the other processing elements. Each connection is assigned a relative weight. A
node’ s output depends on the threshold speci® ed and the transfer function. The two
types of learnin g are supervised and unsupervise d. For supervised learning, a set of
training input vectors with a corresponding set of target vectors is trained to adjust
the weights in a neural network. For unsupervised learning, a set of input vectors is
proposed; however, no target vectors are speci® ed. Our approach towards the performance prediction problem is based on supervised neural networks. Supervised
learning neural network models include back-propaga tion, counter-propagatio n network and learning vector quantization , of which, the back-propaga tion model is
most extensively used and is therefore selected here.
A back-propag ation neural network (BPN ) can be layered into many levels, with
or without hidden layers exhibited between an input and an output layer. Figure 1
illustrates a network of neurons that are organized into a three layer hierarchy.
Back-propag ation learning employs a gradient-descent algorith m (R umelhart and
McClelland 1989) . Through a supervised learning rule, the collected training data set
comprises an input and an actual target output. The gradient-des cent learning algorithm enables a network to enhance the performance by self-learning. Two phases are
availabl e for computation : forward and backward. In the forward phase of backpropagatio n learning, the input data pattern is directly passed into the hidden layer.
Each element of the hidden layer calculate s an activatio n value by summing up the

weighted inputs and then transforms the weighted input into an activity level by
using a transfer function (the sigmoid function is broadly used ) . The resulting activity is allowed to spread throug h the network to the outpu t layer. If a di erence
arises, i.e. an error term, the gradient-des cent algorith m is used to adjust the connected weights, in the backward phase. This learning process is repeated until the
error between the actual and desired output (target) converges to a prede® ned
threshold. A trained neural network is expected to predict the output when a new
In the backward phase, the network output yk is compared with the target value
tk to determine the associated error for that pattern with that unit. Based on this
error, the factor d k is computed. d k is used to distribute the error at output unit Y k
back to all units in the previous layer (the hidden units that are connected to Y k ) . It is
also used to update the weights between the output and the hidden layer. In a similar
manner, the factor d j is computed for each hidden unit Zj . d j is used to update the
weights between the hidden layer and the input layer.
A fter all the d factors have been determined, the weights for all layers are
adjusted simultaneous ly. The adjustment to the weight W jk (from hidden unit Z j
to output unit Y k ) is based on the factor d k , the activatio n zj of the hidden unit Z j,
and the learning rate h . The adjustment to the weights v ij (from input unit Xi to
hidden unit Z j) is based on the factor d j , the activatio n x i of the input unit, and the
learning rate h . The equation utilized to adjust the weights for the output layer k is

A s ® gure 2 shows, constructing a BPN prediction model involves three steps: (a)

(1 ) WIP levels of the current and previous two or three operation stages.
(2 ) Move volume of current and previous two or three operation stages.
(3 ) Disruptive factors such as machine breakdown , preventive maintenance,
operator absence, and poor dispatchin g priorities.
The results presented here demonstrate that the ® rst two factors, WIP levels and
move volume, are signi® cantly explanator y variables for the third one. Therefore, we
select the ® rst two factors as our input variables.
The fact that the performances of previous days and the future performances of
an operation stage correlate with each other necessitates that two further concepts,
operation stage window and operation time window must be de® ned to construct a
Operation stage window: the total number of operation stages involved in constructing the BPN prediction model, which include the current operation stage and
previous operation stages. For instance, if the information retrieved for the BPN
model includes only the current operation stage and the previous two operation
stages, then the operation stage window = 3.
Operation time window: the size of time lagged to capture historical information
from previous days. For instance, the information is captured from the current day
and the previous two days to predict the performance of the current day. Then the
Figure 3 displays a BPN prediction model which is generated to predict the
performance of stage S on date t+ 1 (MOVE s,t+ 1 and WIPs,t+ 1 ) , where t denotes
the observed day, and the input factors’ operation stage window = 2 and operation
Based on the data obtaine d so far, a correlation analysi s has been performed to
help determine the input variables. Table 1 depicts the correlation coe cients of the

(operation stage windows and operation time windows) . The correlation coe cients
shown in bold type are extremely high, indicatin g that the input variable s are acceptable. The p-values of this correlation analysis (H 0 : q = 0, H 1 : q
0 ) are also examined, as listed in table 2. The p-values indicate that the predicted variables are not
independent of the input variable s (p-value % 0.0001 ) . The three-day historical WIP
levels and move volumes in operation stage s 1 do not correlate well with the
predicted move volumes (p-value > 0.05 ) , but they still correlate with the WIP
level on date t+ 1; theref ore, those input variables cannot be excluded. The same
scenario arises for the three-day historical WIP levels, and move volumes in operation stage s 2 do not correlate well with the WIP levels on date t 1.
D eterm ination of the operation tim e window and operation stage window
The correlation analysis in section 3.1 allows us to con® rm the appropriaten ess of
the input variables chosen by previous experience. However, not all the input variables are expected to input to our model. In this study, the experimental design
approac h is employed to derive a better combinatio n of operation stage window
and operation time window so that the prediction error and model complexity can be
reduced. By adoptin g previous experience, a 3 3 factorial design is generated. The
operation stage window and operation time window are determined as the experimental factors (or treatments) . Each factor is classi® ed into three levels (table 3 ) .
Cumulatively, nine di erent BPN models are created.
The data set used to perform the experiment, consisting of 180 records for
six months of daily data, was collected from the Mosel Vitelic Inc., which is a
famous DRA M wafer fabricator in Taiwan. These data include the normal and
abnormal occurrences. A ll the examined stages are located in the following manufacturing modules: photo, etching, thin ® lm and di usion. We delete 50 records
whose data are not complete. To provide a mean for checking the BPN prediction
agains t existing data, the remaining 130 records of available data are sub-divide d
into two sets. The ® rst set, called training data, is used to construct the prediction
model. 106 records of training data are available . To prevent over-training , the
second set, called testing data (24 records ), is used to assess the prediction model’ s
performance during the training process. This training process is repeated until the
testing error, error between the actual and desired output from the testing data,
converges to a prede® ned threshold value. The mean error percentage (MEP) and
coe cient of varianc e (CV ) are calculated to assess the performance of created BPN

Owing to the limitation s of time and cost, only ® ve di erent stages were examined in this experiment. A lthough the results cannot be used to represent the
entire production line, the same analysis procedure can be applie d to analyse any
operation stages in the entire production line. Table 4 summarizes the testing error
and the performance judgment measures for all the nine WIP level and move volume
prediction models. Hence, the average values of MEP used to identify the optimum
model are calculated (table 5) , since the output layer include s the above two predicted variables.
The data are also examined by a two-way A NOVA analysi s (table 6 ) . Some of
those results for a 5% signi® cance level can be summarized as follows.

A BPN model has an input layer, an output layer, and several hidden layers.
Increasing the number of hidden layers increases the complexity of a BPN model.

with an increasing number of hidden layers. Based on previous experience, only one

or two hidden layers yield a better error convergenc e (Y ei 1993 ) . The number of
nodes in a hidden layer is another factor in¯ uencing the training process of creating a
BPN model. Basically, more nodes in a hidden layer result in a smaller prediction
error but a longer training time. Yei (1993 ) also recommended the following principle to determine the number of hidden nodes for the hidden layer: HN (number of
hidden nodes) = (a + b) /2, where a denotes the number of input nodes and b denotes
Sensitivity analysi s is also performed to obtain a more re® ned structure of our
BPN model. The previous BPN model with operation time window = 1 and operation stage window = 3 are modi® ed by di erent numbers of hidden layers and nodes.
Table 8 lists all the level’ s combination s. From the average predicted error for WIP
and Move shown in table 8, the following results are observed.
(1 ) The number of hidden nodes should be determined by Y ei’ s formula
(2 ) One or two hidden layers can yield a better prediction performance and
therefore do not waste the training time.
These predicted errors are examined by a two-way A NOVA analysis . Those results
suggest that the di erences among predicted errors are insigni® cant. Therefore,
advance d analysi s does not have to be applied. The optimum case in table 8 was
chosen to be the structure of our BPN prediction model.
Only ® ve stages were examined in our experiment. However, these results can not
be used to represent the actual circumstances of the entire wafer fabrication .

and move volume. In generally, an operation stage with a larger average variance has
a large prediction error, as shown in table 10. Figure 7 depicts their relationships , as
represented by the scatter chart. From this chart, a ® eld manager can realize that for
the operation stage with a smaller average variance the predicted performance from
the BPN prediction model is more reliable .
Moreover, a multiple regression model was compared with the neural network
prediction model. The models can be expressed as
By using the stepwise regression process, a prediction error of 26% was obtained .
However, the prediction performance is not as high as the BPN model. For the cases
presented here, the BPN prediction model is more appropriat e than the regression
model under the criteria of minimum prediction error.
M anagerial implications and implementation
The previous section explored how to select an optimum BPN prediction model
to accurately predict wafer fabrication performance. Herein, we recommend using a

prediction model. Figure 8 illustrates the detailed process of these two stages. In the
creating stage, the BPN model is trained by the new data obtained from the wafer
fabrication . For this study, six months of information can adequately generate a
In the running stage, the prediction results obtained from the BPN model are
compared with the standard performance measures (standard WIP level and target
move volume ) . The di erence in this comparison (expressed as `low’ , `normal’ , or
`high’ ) allows managers to quickly respond to any undesirable circumstances (table
11) . The corrective action s are based on the interpretations of various combination s
of low, normal and high levels of the predicted outputs. Hence, the way in which
these levels are de® ned becomes very important. Logically, the reliability of this
classi® cation into levels is bound to be highly dependent on the magnitude of the
prediction error. A lthough an experienced manager can roughly determine the levels
with his own experiences and adjust these levels accordingly, the quality aspect of the
prediction control level should be further studied.
De® ning a standar d WIP level and a target move volume at any stage is quite
complex. A lthough this issue is not discussed here, the manager’ s experience and the
historical data help us to obtain a rough standard: (1) standard WIP level, average
WIP during the past one week; and (2 ) target move, month output divide d by the
number of work days. For instance, if the month output is 36 000 wafers and there
are 30 work days in a month, a rough target move for one stage may be 1200 wafers
per stage daily. (36 000 wafers/30 work days = 1200 wafers/stage/day ) .
Model retraining becomes necessary when a system is changed (e.g. new routing
is added ) . Otherwise, the current BPN model loses its ability to accurately predict the
new system’ s performance. The followin g criteria can be applied to determine the
schedule for the model retraining: (1 ) new routing is added, or (2 ) cumulated prediction errors are outside the control limits after some time periods, e.g. two or three

a well-trained BPN model can satisfy the requirement of real time running . Many
commercial neural network program s with a powerful learning ability and good user
interfaces have been developed . Such tools can be easily adapted by managers. In
addition , to conserve the model construction time, the BPN model can only be
