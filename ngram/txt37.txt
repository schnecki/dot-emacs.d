This paper investigates the use of exponentially smoothed
order flow time feedback in setting planned lead times
dynamically. The system studied is a supply chain with
capacity-constrained processing stations and transit times
between stations. Lot sizes are based on the minimization of
flow times using queuing approximations. Both seasonal
and level demand patterns with uncertainty are considered.
Since both dependent and independent demands are
assumed at each station, customer delivery performance
depends on the distribution of inventory along the supply
chain. Results show that dynamic planned lead time setting
can be used effectively to control delivery performance along
the supply chain. Performance is also influenced significantly

Hill and Raturi (1992) suggested this as a
research study emphasizing MRP lot-sizing.
Work load feedback or lot flow time feedback
can also be used in setting planned lead times.
Hoyt (1978) illustrated the use of work load
profiles to estimate queue time requirements. This
approach is responsive to changing work load
conditions but requires good information on the
current shop status and lot service times. Another
approach is to use exponentially smoothed
feedback on the actual flow times being observed.

requirements are more stable. The differences
in planned lead time settings between the level
and seasonal demand patterns was not great. In
part this was because the demand variability
due to uncertainty was quite high relative to the
seasonal pattern variability. Furthermore, the
lag of the demand patterns at the various
echelons was set so seasonal variabilities tend to
be offset each other, especially at upstream
stations. However, it can be noted the planned
lead times at downstream stations vary more
when demand is seasonal. As well, it was found
that the time-average planned lead times were
slightly higher for the seasonal demand pattern.
This is consistent with expectations since the
relationship between utilization and queue
length is not linear. Therefore, we expect queue
lengths to be disproportionately large at peak
seasonal utilizations and this causes planned

Similar results are shown in Figure 11 and

planned lead time adjustment based on work
loads is viable in a capacity-constrained
distribution system. Exponentially smoothed
feedback can be used to effectively set planned
lead times even when queuing delays cannot be
readily predicted. In a supply chain scenario
where there is both dependent and independent
demand at various stages, dynamic planned
lead times which include a safety allowance can
be used to control inventory and delivery
performance along the complete supply chain.

The results also lead us to conclude that

differences in lot sizes affect both inventory and

the safety allowances at each stage were set to
