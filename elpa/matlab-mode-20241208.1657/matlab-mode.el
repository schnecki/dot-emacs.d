;;; Commentary:

;; This major mode for GNU Emacs provides support for editing MATLAB(R)
;; dot-m files.  It automatically indents for block structures (including
;; nested functions), line continuations (e.g., ...), and comments.

;; Additional features include auto-fill including auto-additions of
;; ellipsis for commands, and even strings.  Block/end construct
;; highlighting as you edit.  Primitive code-verification and
;; identification.  Templates and other code editing functions.
;; Advanced symbol completion.  Code highlighting via font-lock.
;; There are many navigation commands that let you move across blocks
;; of code at different levels.

;; Lastly, there is support for running MATLAB(R) in an Emacs buffer,
;; with full shell history and debugger support (when used with the db
;; commands.)  The shell can be used as an online help while editing
;; code, providing help on functions, variables, or running arbitrary
;; blocks of code from the buffer you are editing.

;;; Code:


(require 'matlab)

(provide 'matlab-mode)
